# Building-a-DAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or DAOs for short are one of the key transformative aspects of programmable blockchains. Theyâ€™ve been given a bad rep because of the DAO hack in summer of 2016, but some of the most interesting projects in the crypto space are structured as DAOs. You will learn how DAOs work, how can you participate in a DAO and how to build one yourself. Stack: Solidity, Ethereum Rinkeby testnet, Metamask, web3.js
